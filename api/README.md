## _shared Data
Due to the size of the parametric models and matched molecular pairs databases, the contents of the `_shared` folder are not provided in this repository. 
Generally, these files/folders are required:
* `p_cddd/`: Parameters of the CDDD model (download from https://github.com/jrwnter/cddd#downloading-pretrained-model)
* `chembl_cddd.npz`: Precomputed CDDD representations for a subset of ChEMBL
* `chembl.fragments` and `chembl.mmpdb`: MMPDB fragments and index of ChEMBL subset
